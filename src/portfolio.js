        "With a background in Software Engineering, I have spent the last few years refining my skills, collaborating with amazing teams, and always learning something new üí°.",
        "Recently, I completed my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at EPITA, Paris, where I specialized in Software Engineering. During my end-of-study internship at the √âcole Polytechnique Drahi X-Novation Center as a FullStack Engineer üöÄ, I had the opportunity to work with a dynamic startup. This experience sharpened my skills across both front-end and back-end development while challenging me to solve real-world problems in a fast-paced, innovation-driven environment ‚ö°.",
        "And when I am not coding, you will probably find me learning French üç∑ or unwinding with a good book üìö or some music üé∂. I like to think that a fresh perspective is just as important as clean code.üå±"
